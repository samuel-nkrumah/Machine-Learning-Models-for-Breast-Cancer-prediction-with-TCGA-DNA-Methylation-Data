# Machine-Learning-Models-for-Breast-Cancer-prediction-with-TCGA-DNA-Methylation-Data
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a multi-omic database with information on cancer and normal patients. This project is a spin-off of an African Society of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Codeathon project that aimed to combine TCGA Copy Number Variation (CNV), DNA Methylation and Gene Expression data and build machine learning models for classifying breast cancer subtypes. Unfortunately, that project could not be completed during the codeathon. Here, attempts were made to complete the project by download corresponding CNV, DNA Methylation Data and Gene Expression Data for building the classification models (Elastic Net and K-Nearest Neighbor), however, the TCGA CNV data has no clinical information (eg: whether sample is cancerous or normal) and had to be disregarded. And the DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Data had no patients in common, so only the DNA Methylation Data was used for building the models. Models were trained with pre-normalized DNA Methylation beta-values and used to predict sample type (solid tissue normal vs primary solid tumour). Interestingly, the relevant genes for the Elastic Net classification showed differential methylation when the samples were clustered in a heatmap.
